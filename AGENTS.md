# Agent instructions

<!-- project:start -->

CodenHub is the workspace behind [coden.agency](https://coden.agency): the `@codenhub/*` packages published to npm, and the sites in `apps/` that document and demonstrate them. A published version can be deprecated but never replaced, so a mistake that reaches a release stays in every app that installed it. Read [`docs/specs/packages-lifecycle.md`](docs/specs/packages-lifecycle.md) before changing a published package's exports, behavior, or version.

<!-- project:end -->

This repository is docs-first. [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md) indexes every document. [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) is the workflow every change follows, and [`docs/tooling.md`](docs/tooling.md) lists the commands. Before delivering a change, run the gate [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md#validation) names, `pnpm verify` unless the project narrows it.

## Working agreement

- Use the task's scope and your judgment to choose which documentation and code to inspect. Applicable contributor rules, guidelines, and specifications remain binding; reading less does not waive them.
- Ask when different interpretations would lead to different work. Do not settle an unstated choice about behavior, public API, a security property, or a recorded decision by assuming it. Do everything independent of the answer first, then ask at the point the answer is needed.
- Keep changes small and within the requested scope. Preserve unrelated work.
- A defect found while working on something else is filed and worked around, not fixed on the spot, as [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md#a-defect-found-mid-task) describes. That includes a defect in a dependency you also maintain: the fix belongs in that dependency's repository.
- Never put a secret, token, password, or personal data in a log, an error, a test snapshot, a commit, or a message to the user, including test values you generate. [`docs/guidelines/security.md`](docs/guidelines/security.md) has the rest.
- Report failing checks, skipped steps, and unfinished work plainly, with the output that shows it. Never describe a partial result as complete.
- Close by listing material judgment calls and assumptions so they can be confirmed or reversed.

## Judgment

- Documentation records decisions; it does not prove them right. Follow a decision while it stands, and judge it too: when reviewing or auditing, ask both whether the work matches the decision and whether the decision is right, and report each finding as the one it is. [`docs/guidelines/documentation.md`](docs/guidelines/documentation.md) owns this distinction and the rules for recording and reversing decisions.
- Recorded decisions carry across sessions; a session's preferences do not. Do not reverse a recorded decision, or recommend reversing it, without naming what it did not weigh.
- Ground each finding in a realistic case: the input or calling code, what goes wrong, and for whom. A concern you cannot ground is a question; state it as one.
- A fix that adds or changes a contract, such as an export, an option, a default, a limit, a persisted format, or a dependency, is a decision, not a fix. Present it as the problem, the options, your recommendation, and why, and wait for approval before making it.

## Project specifics

<!-- project:start -->

- **The delivery gate is the branch selection.** `pnpm verify --changed` is the gate before delivering a change, not the whole workspace, which CI runs on every merge; [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md#validation) says when the whole workspace is needed instead.
- **Generated files are regenerated, not edited.** A file marked as generated is derived from package READMEs, `docs/`, and manifests. Change its source and run `pnpm generate <target>`; CI fails on drift rather than fixing it. [Tooling](docs/tooling.md#generated-files) lists the generators.
- **Root tooling selects packages.** Run scripts from the repository root through `hub`'s selectors rather than `pnpm --filter` or from a package directory; it owns the build order of workspace dependencies.

## Knowledge

- Do not keep agent memory files. Knowledge worth keeping belongs in the repository, where it is versioned, reviewed, and available in every checkout: a recorded decision in documentation, a test, or a trap in a scoped `AGENTS.md`.
- Any directory MAY have its own `AGENTS.md`. Before working in a directory, read each `AGENTS.md` on the path from the repository root to it. This file says how to work; a scoped file records the known traps of its scope.
- A trap is information, not a rule: what happens, when trying what, and what to prefer instead, as in "X happens when trying Y; prefer Z". It answers "why isn't this done another way?" without settling it. When a trap may no longer hold, check it, then update or remove it. Rules and decisions belong in documentation, and a scoped file does not restate documentation or this file.
- Make each trap checkable: state the conditions it held under, such as a tool or runtime version, and its evidence when one exists, such as a test, an issue, or a measurement.
- Add a trap in the change that discovers it, when its cause is not evident from the code or documentation. Remove it in the change that removes its cause.

## Context discipline

- Start with filenames, headings, and focused searches; read the sections needed to understand the change and its dependencies. Expand inspection when evidence leaves a question unresolved.
- Reuse information already inspected in the session. Re-read material when it changed or when a specific uncertainty requires it.
- Prefer canonical sources. Generated files, compilations, and references are alternate views, not additional contracts to read alongside their inputs.
- Find code with focused searches (`grep -n`, `rg`) and read the line ranges they point to. Read a whole file only when the change needs all of it, and do not dump several files or a directory in one command (`cat a.ts b.ts`, `for f in …; do cat "$f"; done`).
- Batch independent inspections as parallel tool calls, each kept focused, not as one command whose output is the sum of all of them.
- Narrow commands during development, as [tooling](docs/tooling.md) describes, and reserve the delivery gate [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md#validation) names for the completed change. Retain the checks the contributor workflow requires.
- Read test, build, and CI output as a summary first: filter to failures or the tail, and treat a background task's output file the same way. Open the full log only when the summary leaves a failure unexplained. Keep machine-readable and interactive output usable.
- At a natural boundary, such as an audit finished before fixes start, record what the next phase needs in the repository or the pull request, and suggest continuing in a new session. Every turn resends the whole context.

## Collaboration

- State material findings and remaining uncertainties as work progresses.
- Resolve conflicts between instructions and authoritative documentation explicitly rather than silently choosing a reading.
- Never commit to `main` unless asked to, for that commit, in the moment.
- Pushing a branch, opening a pull request, filing an issue, pushing a release tag, and deploying are outward-facing. Ask first, every time; an earlier approval does not carry over. [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) has the rules.
