# The pre-commit checks for Node.js and pnpm, sourced by `.githooks/pre-commit`,
# which says what each name below provides.
#
# oxfmt formats every staged file it understands and skips the rest, so the hook
# formats the same files `pnpm format:check` checks, including formats oxfmt
# gains in a later version; `ignorePatterns` in `.oxfmtrc.json` keeps it off
# Markdown. Prettier formats Markdown and skips anything `.prettierignore` lists;
# oxlint lints code. A formatter for another language, such as `rustfmt` for
# `rs`, adds its commands to profile_fix and profile_check and to the
# `format:fix` and `format:check` scripts in `package.json`, and its files to
# oxfmt's `ignorePatterns` when oxfmt understands them too.

# Any file with an extension: oxfmt decides which ones it formats.

# oxfmt and oxlint exit non-zero when none of the files they are handed is one
# they read, whether ignored by their config or, for oxfmt, of a format it does
# not know; `--no-error-on-unmatched-pattern` turns that back into a pass, since
# committing such a file is not a failure.
